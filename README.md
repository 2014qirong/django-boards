# django-boards/punkweb
Django forum boards with bbcode support.


This project aims to eventually be pip installable and easily integrated into
your own project.  However, at the moment this code base is tied specifically
to a running community.  If you really wanted to you could clone/fork this project
and start making the necessary customizations to run it yourself, in which case
I would gladly offer support.

### Demo/Documentation

Check out our community at [PunkWeb](https://punkweb.us/board/) for
a live demonstration of django-boards, or view the [documentation](https://punkweb.us/board/page/docs-index/)!

### A note about sceditor (BBCode editor)

In order to keep this repository clean I am not including the source for the
bbcode editor in the static assets folder.


I may make a separate repository for the bbcode editor, as I plan to hack it to
fit special needs for this project.


For now, download [SCEditor](http://www.sceditor.com/) and unzip it at:
`django-boards/static/sceditor/`


### Supported BBCode tags

all the supported BBCode tags on django-boards and how to use them.


### Almost ready for use!

Check out the 'Ready' milestone under issues to see what's left before this is at
a usable state.
