# django-boards/punkweb
Django forum boards with bbcode support.


### Demo/Documentation

Check out our community at [PunkWeb](https://punkweb.us/board/) for
documentation and a live demonstration of django-boards!

### A note about sceditor (BBCode editor)

In order to keep this repository clean I am not including the source for the
bbcode editor in the static assets folder.


I may make a separate repository for the bbcode editor, as I plan to hack it to
fit special needs for this project.


For now, download [SCEditor](http://www.sceditor.com/) and unzip it at:
`django-boards/static/sceditor/`


### Custom bbcode tags

Check out `apps/api/bbcode_tags.py` to see the available custom tags and add others.


### Almost ready for use!

Check out the 'Ready' milestone under issues to see what's left before this is at
a usable state.
